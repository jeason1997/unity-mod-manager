This mod allows you to use mods on games that do not support modding.

How it works? 
Mod manager works only inside game and besides the installer does not have other programs. 
Universal installer will apply a patch to a game for that would be able to use mods.
The list of available games for the installation is not complete, but will be updated as needed.
To add a new game, you can write me a comment or add yourself editing the file UnityModManagerConfig.xml

Available games
Oxygen Not Included
Subnautica
Motorsport Manager
Two Point Hospital
